### 4. Add the ability to send a photo

Objectives:
- Install the camera plugin following the instructions at https://ionicframework.com/docs/v2/native/camera/
- Add a button in the left-hand side of the footer to capture a photo (home.html).
- Add a method which handles capturing a photo for the user.  Review the instructions in the first
  bullet point for direction on this.
- run `ionic upload` from the command prompt to push your changes to Ionic View on your mobile device 


Please use the below option settings for the getPicture method on the camera:
```javascript
{
      destinationType: this.camera.DestinationType.DATA_URL,
      encodingType: this.camera.EncodingType.JPEG,
      mediaType: this.camera.MediaType.PICTURE
}
```

Also, the code example that ionic provides for capturing a photo has not worked out of the box for me:
```ts
this.camera.getPicture(options).then((imageData) => {
 // imageData is either a base64 encoded string or a file URI
 // If it's base64:
 let base64Image = 'data:image/jpeg;base64,' + imageData;
}, (err) => {
 // Handle error
});
```

You will INSTEAD need to trim out some un-needed characters in the image, below is a corrected example showing how this is done:
```ts
this.camera.getPicture(options).then((imageData) => {
 // imageData is either a base64 encoded string or a file URI
 // If it's base64:
 let base64Image = 'data:image/jpeg;base64,' + imageData.replace(/[\n\r]/g, '');
}, (err) => {
 // Handle error
});
```

Note:
- This is a feature that will only work on your mobile device.  I will not work in your browser.
- Once done and working, new messages will appear looking like "data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/4AAQSkZ..." which is expected (for now).
