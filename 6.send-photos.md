### 6. Add the ability to send a photo

Refer to https://ionicframework.com/docs/v2/native/camera/ for reference on how to add camera functionality to this app.

Use the below option settings for the getPicture method on the camera:
```javascript
{
  destinationType: Camera.DestinationType.DATA_URL,
  targetWidth: 400,
  targetHeight: 300
}
```

Once you are saving messages with the resulting image, they will by default be displayed in a text format.  You will need to display the image data properly when the given message does contain an image.
