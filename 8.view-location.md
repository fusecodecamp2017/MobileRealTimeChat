### 8. Add the ability to view photos

Objectives:
- Use the Platform service to determine if the device you are using is Apple(ios) or Android. https://ionicframework.com/docs/api/platform/Platform/
- Use an anchor <a> tag to provide the location.  The href attribute like shown below.
  * Apple: https://maps.apple.com/?q=<latitude>,<longitude>
  * Android: https://maps.google.com/maps?q=loc:<latitude>,<longitude>
- Be mindful that this feature should only be visible in messages where it was provided in the earlier format, "geo:<latitude>,<longitude>" .
