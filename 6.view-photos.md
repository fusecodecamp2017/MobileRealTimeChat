### 6. Add the ability to view photos

Objectives:
Update the messages being viewed so that instead of nonsense like "data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/4AAQSkZ...", you actually see an image.  That's really all there is to it.  An <img> tag will be needed to provide the message content so you will need to switch between that and the normal <p> tag where messageContent is normally displayed.  There is a ngIf directive that can be leveraged for visibility of either tag.
